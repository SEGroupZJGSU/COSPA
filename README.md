# Introduction
This is the replication package for our work published by IEEE ACCESS, i.e., Xin Du, Tian Wang, Weifeng Pan, Muchou Wang, Bo Jiang, Yiming Xiang, Chunlai Chai, Jiale Wang, and Chengxiang Yuan. COSPA: Identifying Key Classes in Object-Oriented Software using Preference Aggregation. IEEE Access, 2021, 9: 28076-28088. [[PDF](#)]

Author Contributions: Xin Du performed the experiments and analyzed the data. Xin Du and Tian Wang wrote the paper. Weifeng Pan conceived of the idea. Other authors proofread the paper. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.

# CCNs
The CCNs directory contains the CCNs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. It also contains the metric data of the classes in the corresponding software project using our approach and the approaches in the baseline. Note that we only provide some sample CCNs; the whole data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# MinClass
The MinClass directory contains the Python code which implements our MinClass approach and the approaches in the baseline. It is a small part of our own developped software, SNAP. Of course, the SNAP software can be obtained by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).
