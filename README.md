# Introduction
This is the replication package for our work published by IEEE ACCESS, i.e., Xin Du, Tian Wang, Weifeng Pan, Muchou Wang, Bo Jiang, Yiming Xiang, Chunlai Chai, Jiale Wang, Chengxiang Yuan. COSPA: Identifying Key Classes in Object-Oriented Software Using Preference Aggregation. IEEE Access, vol. 9, pp. 114767-114780, 2021, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3105475. [[PDF](#)]

Author Contributions: Xin Du performed the experiments and analyzed the data. Xin Du and Tian Wang wrote the paper. Weifeng Pan conceived of the idea. Other authors proofread the paper. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.

# data
The data directory contains the metric data that we computed for all the claases in the subject systems. Note that we only provide the metric data and do not provide the CCNs we built for all the subject systems. Interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get other data that we mentioned in our work. Please use your institutional email address.

# script
The script directory contains the Python code which implements our COSPA approach. You cannot directly use this script since we delete some columns originally stored in the .csv files in the data directory. Thus, to use this script, you should put the above data directory into the script directory and slightly adapt the source code to fit in with the data format of our .csv file. Note that it is a small part of our own developped software, SNAP. Of course, the SNAP software can be obtained by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).
